# DatapackExtensions
Adds more features to minecraft commands and datapacks

## Purpose
This mod is specifically intended to contain extensions in a form that Mojang are more likely to consider adding to the game.

Breaking changes may occur at any time if feedback from Mojang devs is provided, or if simpler forms of features are determined which are more likely to be accepted.

Any new features will be considered in great detail, and may be split into the minimal feature to make it useful and any number of "extension" to that feature which are not strictly necessary but would be useful
